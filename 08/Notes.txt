removing 1

3 is fcd or 
then we remove 7 (and drop 8)
cgf fgac cg fcg agf fc fac
6 is size 4 or fgac or fgaecd

0 -
1 - be
2 - 
3 - fabcd
4 - cgeb
5 - 
6 - fgaecd
7 - edb
8 - cfbegad
9 - 


We know 1 since it's size 2
We know 4 since it's the only size 4
We know 8 since it's the only size 7
We know 7 since it's the only size 3

if we remove 1 from the rest of the strings we can find 3 as it will be the only one of size 3

if we remove 1 from 7 we get A
if we count the character occurances the one appearing 6 times is B
if we count the character occurances A and C appear 8 times (we know which is A so we can get C)
if we count the character occurances E appears 4 times
if we count the character occurances F appears 9 times
if we remove B C and F from 4 we get D
that leaves the last one to be G (or we can remove all from 8 and that would leave G)

once we have the correct mappings we can use them to read the output numbers

if we remove 7 from 8 and add A we get 6
if we remove 1 from all and get size 3 then thats 3
if we add 3 and 4 we get 9
if we remove 9 from 8 we get E
if we count the character occurances the one appearing 9 times is F
if we count the character occurances the one appearing 6 times is B
if we remove B from 4 and then remove 1 from 4 we get D
